  .. py:method:: add_attachments_to_set(**kwargs)

    

    Adds one or more attachments to an attachment set. If an ``attachmentSetId`` is not specified, a new attachment set is created, and the ID of the set is returned in the response. If an ``attachmentSetId`` is specified, the attachments are added to the specified set, if it exists.

     

    An attachment set is a temporary container for attachments that are to be added to a case or case communication. The set is available for one hour after it is created; the ``expiryTime`` returned in the response indicates when the set expires. The maximum number of attachments in a set is 3, and the maximum size of any attachment in the set is 5 MB.

  .. py:method:: add_communication_to_case(**kwargs)

    

    Adds additional customer communication to an AWS Support case. You use the ``caseId`` value to identify the case to add communication to. You can list a set of email addresses to copy on the communication using the ``ccEmailAddresses`` value. The ``communicationBody`` value contains the text of the communication.

     

    The response indicates the success or failure of the request.

     

    This operation implements a subset of the features of the AWS Support Center.

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: create_case(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a new case in the AWS Support Center. This operation is modeled on the behavior of the AWS Support Center `Create Case`_ page. Its parameters require you to specify the following information: 

     

     
    * **issueType.** The type of issue for the case. You can specify either "customer-service" or "technical." If you do not indicate a value, the default is "technical."  
     
    * **serviceCode.** The code for an AWS service. You obtain the ``serviceCode`` by calling  DescribeServices .  
     
    * **categoryCode.** The category for the service defined for the ``serviceCode`` value. You also obtain the category code for a service by calling  DescribeServices . Each AWS service defines its own set of category codes.  
     
    * **severityCode.** A value that indicates the urgency of the case, which in turn determines the response time according to your service level agreement with AWS Support. You obtain the SeverityCode by calling  DescribeSeverityLevels . 
     
    * **subject.** The **Subject** field on the AWS Support Center `Create Case`_ page. 
     
    * **communicationBody.** The **Description** field on the AWS Support Center `Create Case`_ page. 
     
    * **attachmentSetId.** The ID of a set of attachments that has been created by using  AddAttachmentsToSet . 
     
    * **language.** The human language in which AWS Support handles the case. English and Japanese are currently supported. 
     
    * **ccEmailAddresses.** The AWS Support Center **CC** field on the `Create Case`_ page. You can list email addresses to be copied on any correspondence about the case. The account that opens the case is already identified by passing the AWS Credentials in the HTTP POST method or in a method or function call from one of the programming languages supported by an `AWS SDK`_ .  
     

     

    .. note::

       

      To add additional communication or attachments to an existing case, use  AddCommunicationToCase .

       

     

    A successful  CreateCase request returns an AWS Support case number. Case numbers are used by the  DescribeCases operation to retrieve existing AWS Support cases.

      .. note::

         

        The availability of severity levels depends on each customer's support subscription. In other words, your subscription may not necessarily require the urgent level of response time.

  .. py:method:: describe_cases(**kwargs)

    

    Returns a list of cases that you specify by passing one or more case IDs. In addition, you can filter the cases by date by setting values for the ``afterTime`` and ``beforeTime`` request parameters. You can set values for the ``includeResolvedCases`` and ``includeCommunications`` request parameters to control how much information is returned. 

     

    Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was created more than 12 months ago, a request for data might cause an error.

    Returns communications (and attachments) for one or more support cases. You can use the ``afterTime`` and ``beforeTime`` parameters to filter by date. You can use the ``caseId`` parameter to restrict the results to a particular case.

     

    Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was created more than 12 months ago, a request for data might cause an error.

     

    You can use the ``maxResults`` and ``nextToken`` parameters to control the pagination of the result set. Set ``maxResults`` to the number of cases you want displayed on each page, and use ``nextToken`` to specify the resumption of pagination.

    Returns the current list of AWS services and a list of service categories that applies to each one. You then use service names and categories in your  CreateCase requests. Each AWS service has its own set of categories.

The values in those fields, however, do not necessarily match the service codes and categories returned by the ``DescribeServices`` request. Always use the service codes and categories obtained programmatically. This practice ensures that you always have the most recent set of service and category codes.
