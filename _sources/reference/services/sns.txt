    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: can_paginate(operation_name)

        
    Check if an operation can be paginated.
    
    :type operation_name: string
    :param operation_name: The operation name.  This is the same name
        as the method name on the client.  For example, if the
        method name is ``create_foo``, and you'd normally invoke the
        operation as ``client.create_foo(**kwargs)``, if the
        ``create_foo`` operation can be paginated, you can use the
        call ``client.get_paginator("create_foo")``.
    
    :return: ``True`` if the operation can be paginated,
        ``False`` otherwise.


  .. py:method:: check_if_phone_number_is_opted_out(**kwargs)

    

    Accepts a phone number and indicates whether the phone holder has opted out of receiving SMS messages from your account. You cannot send SMS messages to a number that is opted out.

     

    To resume sending messages, you can opt in the number by using the ``OptInPhoneNumber`` action.

          phoneNumber='string'
      )
    :type phoneNumber: string
    :param phoneNumber: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The phone number for which you want to check the opt out status.

      

    
    
    :rtype: dict
    :returns: 
      
      **Response Syntax** 

      
      ::

        {
            'isOptedOut': True|False
        }
      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        The response from the ``CheckIfPhoneNumberIsOptedOut`` action.

        
        

        - **isOptedOut** *(boolean) --* 

          Indicates whether the phone number is opted out:

           

           
          * ``true`` – The phone number is opted out, meaning you cannot publish SMS messages to it. 
           
          * ``false`` – The phone number is opted in, meaning you can publish SMS messages to it. 
           

          
    

  .. py:method:: confirm_subscription(**kwargs)

    

    Verifies an endpoint owner's intent to receive messages by validating the token sent to the endpoint by an earlier ``Subscribe`` action. If the token is valid, the action creates a new subscription and returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This call requires an AWS signature only when the ``AuthenticateOnUnsubscribe`` flag is set to "true".

    

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.confirm_subscription(
          TopicArn='string',
          Token='string',
          AuthenticateOnUnsubscribe='string'
      )
    :type TopicArn: string
    :param TopicArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ARN of the topic for which you wish to confirm a subscription.

      

    
    :type Token: string
    :param Token: **[REQUIRED]**

      Disallows unauthenticated unsubscribes of the subscription. If the value of this parameter is ``true`` and the request has an AWS signature, then only the topic owner and the subscription owner can unsubscribe the endpoint. The unsubscribe action requires AWS authentication. 

      

    
    
    :rtype: dict
    :returns: 
      
      **Response Syntax**

  .. py:method:: create_platform_application(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a platform application object for one of the supported push notification services, such as APNS and GCM, to which devices and mobile apps may register. You must specify PlatformPrincipal and PlatformCredential attributes when using the ``CreatePlatformApplication`` action. The PlatformPrincipal is received from the notification service. For APNS/APNS_SANDBOX, PlatformPrincipal is "SSL certificate". For GCM, PlatformPrincipal is not applicable. For ADM, PlatformPrincipal is "client id". The PlatformCredential is also received from the notification service. For WNS, PlatformPrincipal is "Package Security Identifier". For MPNS, PlatformPrincipal is "TLS certificate". For Baidu, PlatformPrincipal is "API key".

     

    For APNS/APNS_SANDBOX, PlatformCredential is "private key". For GCM, PlatformCredential is "API key". For ADM, PlatformCredential is "client secret". For WNS, PlatformCredential is "secret key". For MPNS, PlatformCredential is "private key". For Baidu, PlatformCredential is "secret key". The PlatformApplicationArn that is returned when using ``CreatePlatformApplication`` is then used as an attribute for the ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` action. For more information, see `Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications`_ . For more information about obtaining the PlatformPrincipal and PlatformCredential for each of the supported push notification services, see `Getting Started with Apple Push Notification Service`_ , `Getting Started with Amazon Device Messaging`_ , `Getting Started with Baidu Cloud Push`_ , `Getting Started with Google Cloud Messaging for Android`_ , `Getting Started with MPNS`_ , or `Getting Started with WNS`_ .

          Platform='string',
          Attributes={
              'string': 'string'
          }
      )
    :type Name: string
    :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Application names must be made up of only uppercase and lowercase ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods, and must be between 1 and 256 characters long.

      

    
    :type Platform: string
    :param Platform: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The following platforms are supported: ADM (Amazon Device Messaging), APNS (Apple Push Notification Service), APNS_SANDBOX, and GCM (Google Cloud Messaging).

      

    
    :type Attributes: dict
    :param Attributes: **[REQUIRED]**

        }
      **Response Structure** 

      

      - *(dict) --* 

        Response from CreatePlatformApplication action.

        
        

        - **PlatformApplicationArn** *(string) --* 

          PlatformApplicationArn is returned.

          
    

  .. py:method:: create_platform_endpoint(**kwargs)

    

    Creates an endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported push notification services, such as GCM and APNS. ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` requires the PlatformApplicationArn that is returned from ``CreatePlatformApplication`` . The EndpointArn that is returned when using ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` can then be used by the ``Publish`` action to send a message to a mobile app or by the ``Subscribe`` action for subscription to a topic. The ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` action is idempotent, so if the requester already owns an endpoint with the same device token and attributes, that endpoint's ARN is returned without creating a new endpoint. For more information, see `Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications`_ . 

     

    When using ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` with Baidu, two attributes must be provided: ChannelId and UserId. The token field must also contain the ChannelId. For more information, see `Creating an Amazon SNS Endpoint for Baidu`_ . 

    

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.create_platform_endpoint(
          PlatformApplicationArn='string',

          Attributes={
              'string': 'string'
          }
      )
    :type PlatformApplicationArn: string
    :param PlatformApplicationArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      PlatformApplicationArn returned from CreatePlatformApplication is used to create a an endpoint.

      

    
    :type Token: string
    :param Token: **[REQUIRED]** 

      Unique identifier created by the notification service for an app on a device. The specific name for Token will vary, depending on which notification service is being used. For example, when using APNS as the notification service, you need the device token. Alternatively, when using GCM or ADM, the device token equivalent is called the registration ID.

      

    
    :type CustomUserData: string
    :param CustomUserData: 

      Arbitrary user data to associate with the endpoint. Amazon SNS does not use this data. The data must be in UTF-8 format and less than 2KB.

      

    
    :type Attributes: dict
    :param Attributes: 

      For a list of attributes, see `SetEndpointAttributes`_ .

        Response from CreateEndpoint action.

        
        

        - **EndpointArn** *(string) --* 

          EndpointArn returned from CreateEndpoint action.

          
    

  .. py:method:: create_topic(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a topic to which notifications can be published. Users can create at most 100,000 topics. For more information, see `http\://aws.amazon.com/sns`_ . This action is idempotent, so if the requester already owns a topic with the specified name, that topic's ARN is returned without creating a new topic.

    

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.create_topic(
          Name='string'
      )
    :type Name: string
    :param Name: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The name of the topic you want to create.

       

      Constraints: Topic names must be made up of only uppercase and lowercase ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens, and must be between 1 and 256 characters long.

      

    
    
    :rtype: dict
    :returns:

        Response from CreateTopic action.

        
        

        - **TopicArn** *(string) --* 

          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) assigned to the created topic.

          
    

  .. py:method:: delete_endpoint(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes the endpoint for a device and mobile app from Amazon SNS. This action is idempotent. For more information, see `Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications`_ . 

     

    When you delete an endpoint that is also subscribed to a topic, then you must also unsubscribe the endpoint from the topic.

    

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.delete_endpoint(
          EndpointArn='string'
      )
    :type EndpointArn: string

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.delete_topic(
          TopicArn='string'
      )
    :type TopicArn: string
    :param TopicArn: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The ARN of the topic you want to delete.

      

    
    
    :returns: None

  .. py:method:: generate_presigned_url(ClientMethod, Params=None, ExpiresIn=3600, HttpMethod=None)

        
    Generate a presigned url given a client, its method, and arguments
    
    :type ClientMethod: string
    :param ClientMethod: The client method to presign for

  .. py:method:: publish(**kwargs)

    

    Sends a message to all of a topic's subscribed endpoints. When a ``messageId`` is returned, the message has been saved and Amazon SNS will attempt to deliver it to the topic's subscribers shortly. The format of the outgoing message to each subscribed endpoint depends on the notification protocol.

     

    To use the ``Publish`` action for sending a message to a mobile endpoint, such as an app on a Kindle device or mobile phone, you must specify the EndpointArn for the TargetArn parameter. The EndpointArn is returned when making a call with the ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` action. 

     

    For more information about formatting messages, see `Send Custom Platform-Specific Payloads in Messages to Mobile Devices`_ .

          }
      )
    :type TopicArn: string
    :param TopicArn: 

      The topic you want to publish to.

       

      If you don't specify a value for the ``TopicArn`` parameter, you must specify a value for the ``PhoneNumber`` or ``TargetArn`` parameters.

      

    
    :type TargetArn: string
    :param TargetArn: 

      Either TopicArn or EndpointArn, but not both.

       

      If you don't specify a value for the ``TargetArn`` parameter, you must specify a value for the ``PhoneNumber`` or ``TopicArn`` parameters.

      

    
    :type PhoneNumber: string
    :param PhoneNumber: 

      The phone number to which you want to deliver an SMS message. Use E.164 format.

       

      If you don't specify a value for the ``PhoneNumber`` parameter, you must specify a value for the ``TargetArn`` or ``TopicArn`` parameters.

      

    
    :type Message: string
    :param Message: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The message you want to send to the topic.

       

      If you want to send the same message to all transport protocols, include the text of the message as a String value.

       

      If you want to send different messages for each transport protocol, set the value of the ``MessageStructure`` parameter to ``json`` and use a JSON object for the ``Message`` parameter. 

       

      Constraints: Messages must be UTF-8 encoded strings at most 256 KB in size (262144 bytes, not 262144 characters).

       

      JSON-specific constraints:

       

       
      * Keys in the JSON object that correspond to supported transport protocols must have simple JSON string values. 
       
      * The values will be parsed (unescaped) before they are used in outgoing messages. 
       
      * Outbound notifications are JSON encoded (meaning that the characters will be reescaped for sending). 
       
      * Values have a minimum length of 0 (the empty string, "", is allowed). 
       
      * Values have a maximum length bounded by the overall message size (so, including multiple protocols may limit message sizes). 
       
      * Non-string values will cause the key to be ignored. 
       
      * Keys that do not correspond to supported transport protocols are ignored. 
       
      * Duplicate keys are not allowed. 
       
      * Failure to parse or validate any key or value in the message will cause the ``Publish`` call to return an error (no partial delivery). 
       

      

    
    :type Subject: string
    :param Subject: 

      Optional parameter to be used as the "Subject" line when the message is delivered to email endpoints. This field will also be included, if present, in the standard JSON messages delivered to other endpoints.

       

      Constraints: Subjects must be ASCII text that begins with a letter, number, or punctuation mark; must not include line breaks or control characters; and must be less than 100 characters long.

      

    
    :type MessageStructure: string
    :param MessageStructure: 

      Set ``MessageStructure`` to ``json`` if you want to send a different message for each protocol. For example, using one publish action, you can send a short message to your SMS subscribers and a longer message to your email subscribers. If you set ``MessageStructure`` to ``json`` , the value of the ``Message`` parameter must: 

       

       
      * be a syntactically valid JSON object; and 
       
      * contain at least a top-level JSON key of "default" with a value that is a string. 
       

       

      You can define other top-level keys that define the message you want to send to a specific transport protocol (e.g., "http").

       

      For information about sending different messages for each protocol using the AWS Management Console, go to `Create Different Messages for Each Protocol`_ in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Getting Started Guide* . 

       

      Valid value: ``json``  

      

    
    :type MessageAttributes: dict
    :param MessageAttributes: 

      Message attributes for Publish action.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          The user-specified message attribute value. For string data types, the value attribute has the same restrictions on the content as the message body. For more information, see `Publish`_ .

           

          Name, type, and value must not be empty or null. In addition, the message body should not be empty or null. All parts of the message attribute, including name, type, and value, are included in the message size restriction, which is currently 256 KB (262,144 bytes). For more information, see `Using Amazon SNS Message Attributes`_ .

          

        
          - **DataType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Amazon SNS supports the following logical data types: String, Number, and Binary. For more information, see `Message Attribute Data Types`_ .

            

          
          - **StringValue** *(string) --* 

            Strings are Unicode with UTF8 binary encoding. For a list of code values, see `http\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters`_ .

  .. py:method:: set_sms_attributes(**kwargs)

    

    Use this request to set the default settings for sending SMS messages and receiving daily SMS usage reports.

     

    You can override some of these settings for a single message when you use the ``Publish`` action with the ``MessageAttributes.entry.N`` parameter. For more information, see `Sending an SMS Message`_ in the *Amazon SNS Developer Guide* .

    

    **Request Syntax** 
    ::

      response = client.set_sms_attributes(

              'string': 'string'
          }
      )
    :type attributes: dict
    :param attributes: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The default settings for sending SMS messages from your account. You can set values for the following attribute names:

       

       ``MonthlySpendLimit`` – The maximum amount in USD that you are willing to spend each month to send SMS messages. When Amazon SNS determines that sending an SMS message would incur a cost that exceeds this limit, it stops sending SMS messages within minutes.

       

      .. warning::

         

        Amazon SNS stops sending SMS messages within minutes of the limit being crossed. During that interval, if you continue to send SMS messages, you will incur costs that exceed your limit.

         

       

      By default, the spend limit is set to the maximum allowed by Amazon SNS. If you want to exceed the maximum, contact `AWS Support`_ or your AWS sales representative for a service limit increase.

       

       ``DeliveryStatusIAMRole`` – The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon SNS to write logs about SMS deliveries in CloudWatch Logs. For each SMS message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that includes the message price, the success or failure status, the reason for failure (if the message failed), the message dwell time, and other information.

       

       ``DeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate`` – The percentage of successful SMS deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write logs in CloudWatch Logs. The value can be an integer from 0 - 100. For example, to write logs only for failed deliveries, set this value to ``0`` . To write logs for 10% of your successful deliveries, set it to ``10`` .

       

       ``DefaultSenderID`` – A string, such as your business brand, that is displayed as the sender on the receiving device. Support for sender IDs varies by country. The sender ID can be 1 - 11 alphanumeric characters, and it must contain at least one letter.

       

       ``DefaultSMSType`` – The type of SMS message that you will send by default. You can assign the following values:

       

       
      * ``Promotional`` – (Default) Noncritical messages, such as marketing messages. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to incur the lowest cost. 
       
      * ``Transactional`` – Critical messages that support customer transactions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor authentication. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to achieve the highest reliability. 
       

       

       ``UsageReportS3Bucket`` – The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to receive daily SMS usage reports from Amazon SNS. Each day, Amazon SNS will deliver a usage report as a CSV file to the bucket. The report includes the following information for each SMS message that was successfully delivered by your account:

       

       
      * Time that the message was published (in UTC) 
       
      * Message ID 
       
      * Destination phone number 
       
      * Message type 
       
      * Delivery status 
       
      * Message price (in USD) 
       
      * Part number (a message is split into multiple parts if it is too long for a single message) 
       
      * Total number of parts 
       

       

      To receive the report, the bucket must have a policy that allows the Amazon SNS service principle to perform the ``s3:PutObject`` and ``s3:GetBucketLocation`` actions.

       

      For an example bucket policy and usage report, see `Monitoring SMS Activity`_ in the *Amazon SNS Developer Guide* .

  .. py:method:: unsubscribe(**kwargs)

    

    Deletes a subscription. If the subscription requires authentication for deletion, only the owner of the subscription or the topic's owner can unsubscribe, and an AWS signature is required. If the ``Unsubscribe`` call does not require authentication and the requester is not the subscription owner, a final cancellation message is delivered to the endpoint, so that the endpoint owner can easily resubscribe to the topic if the ``Unsubscribe`` request was unintended.

  .. py:method:: create_platform_application(**kwargs)

    

    Creates a platform application object for one of the supported push notification services, such as APNS and GCM, to which devices and mobile apps may register. You must specify PlatformPrincipal and PlatformCredential attributes when using the ``CreatePlatformApplication`` action. The PlatformPrincipal is received from the notification service. For APNS/APNS_SANDBOX, PlatformPrincipal is "SSL certificate". For GCM, PlatformPrincipal is not applicable. For ADM, PlatformPrincipal is "client id". The PlatformCredential is also received from the notification service. For WNS, PlatformPrincipal is "Package Security Identifier". For MPNS, PlatformPrincipal is "TLS certificate". For Baidu, PlatformPrincipal is "API key".

     

    For APNS/APNS_SANDBOX, PlatformCredential is "private key". For GCM, PlatformCredential is "API key". For ADM, PlatformCredential is "client secret". For WNS, PlatformCredential is "secret key". For MPNS, PlatformCredential is "private key". For Baidu, PlatformCredential is "secret key". The PlatformApplicationArn that is returned when using ``CreatePlatformApplication`` is then used as an attribute for the ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` action. For more information, see `Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications`_ . For more information about obtaining the PlatformPrincipal and PlatformCredential for each of the supported push notification services, see `Getting Started with Apple Push Notification Service`_ , `Getting Started with Amazon Device Messaging`_ , `Getting Started with Baidu Cloud Push`_ , `Getting Started with Google Cloud Messaging for Android`_ , `Getting Started with MPNS`_ , or `Getting Started with WNS`_ .

  Actions
  
  Actions call operations on resources.  They may automatically handle the passing in of arguments set from identifiers and some attributes.
  For more information about actions refer to the :ref:`Resources Introduction Guide<actions_intro>`.
  

  .. py:method:: create_platform_endpoint(**kwargs)

    

    Creates an endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported push notification services, such as GCM and APNS. ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` requires the PlatformApplicationArn that is returned from ``CreatePlatformApplication`` . The EndpointArn that is returned when using ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` can then be used by the ``Publish`` action to send a message to a mobile app or by the ``Subscribe`` action for subscription to a topic. The ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` action is idempotent, so if the requester already owns an endpoint with the same device token and attributes, that endpoint's ARN is returned without creating a new endpoint. For more information, see `Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications`_ . 

     

    When using ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` with Baidu, two attributes must be provided: ChannelId and UserId. The token field must also contain the ChannelId. For more information, see `Creating an Amazon SNS Endpoint for Baidu`_ .

      Unique identifier created by the notification service for an app on a device. The specific name for Token will vary, depending on which notification service is being used. For example, when using APNS as the notification service, you need the device token. Alternatively, when using GCM or ADM, the device token equivalent is called the registration ID.

      

    
    :type CustomUserData: string
    :param CustomUserData: 

      Arbitrary user data to associate with the endpoint. Amazon SNS does not use this data. The data must be in UTF-8 format and less than 2KB.

    To use the ``Publish`` action for sending a message to a mobile endpoint, such as an app on a Kindle device or mobile phone, you must specify the EndpointArn for the TargetArn parameter. The EndpointArn is returned when making a call with the ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` action. 

     

    For more information about formatting messages, see `Send Custom Platform-Specific Payloads in Messages to Mobile Devices`_ .

              }
          }
      )
    :type TopicArn: string
    :param TopicArn: 

      The topic you want to publish to.

       

      If you don't specify a value for the ``TopicArn`` parameter, you must specify a value for the ``PhoneNumber`` or ``TargetArn`` parameters.

      

    
    :type PhoneNumber: string
    :param PhoneNumber: 

      The phone number to which you want to deliver an SMS message. Use E.164 format.

       

      If you don't specify a value for the ``PhoneNumber`` parameter, you must specify a value for the ``TargetArn`` or ``TopicArn`` parameters.

      

    
    :type Message: string
    :param Message: **[REQUIRED]** 

      The message you want to send to the topic.

       

      If you want to send the same message to all transport protocols, include the text of the message as a String value.

       

      If you want to send different messages for each transport protocol, set the value of the ``MessageStructure`` parameter to ``json`` and use a JSON object for the ``Message`` parameter. 

       

      Constraints: Messages must be UTF-8 encoded strings at most 256 KB in size (262144 bytes, not 262144 characters).

       

      JSON-specific constraints:

       

       
      * Keys in the JSON object that correspond to supported transport protocols must have simple JSON string values. 
       
      * The values will be parsed (unescaped) before they are used in outgoing messages. 
       
      * Outbound notifications are JSON encoded (meaning that the characters will be reescaped for sending). 
       
      * Values have a minimum length of 0 (the empty string, "", is allowed). 
       
      * Values have a maximum length bounded by the overall message size (so, including multiple protocols may limit message sizes). 
       
      * Non-string values will cause the key to be ignored. 
       
      * Keys that do not correspond to supported transport protocols are ignored. 
       
      * Duplicate keys are not allowed. 
       
      * Failure to parse or validate any key or value in the message will cause the ``Publish`` call to return an error (no partial delivery). 
       

      

    
    :type Subject: string
    :param Subject: 

      Optional parameter to be used as the "Subject" line when the message is delivered to email endpoints. This field will also be included, if present, in the standard JSON messages delivered to other endpoints.

       

      Constraints: Subjects must be ASCII text that begins with a letter, number, or punctuation mark; must not include line breaks or control characters; and must be less than 100 characters long.

      

    
    :type MessageStructure: string
    :param MessageStructure: 

      Set ``MessageStructure`` to ``json`` if you want to send a different message for each protocol. For example, using one publish action, you can send a short message to your SMS subscribers and a longer message to your email subscribers. If you set ``MessageStructure`` to ``json`` , the value of the ``Message`` parameter must: 

       

       
      * be a syntactically valid JSON object; and 
       
      * contain at least a top-level JSON key of "default" with a value that is a string. 
       

       

      You can define other top-level keys that define the message you want to send to a specific transport protocol (e.g., "http").

       

      For information about sending different messages for each protocol using the AWS Management Console, go to `Create Different Messages for Each Protocol`_ in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Getting Started Guide* . 

       

      Valid value: ``json``

    :param MessageAttributes: 

      Message attributes for Publish action.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          The user-specified message attribute value. For string data types, the value attribute has the same restrictions on the content as the message body. For more information, see `Publish`_ .

           

          Name, type, and value must not be empty or null. In addition, the message body should not be empty or null. All parts of the message attribute, including name, type, and value, are included in the message size restriction, which is currently 256 KB (262,144 bytes). For more information, see `Using Amazon SNS Message Attributes`_ .

          

        
          - **DataType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Amazon SNS supports the following logical data types: String, Number, and Binary. For more information, see `Message Attribute Data Types`_ .

            

          
          - **StringValue** *(string) --* 

            Strings are Unicode with UTF8 binary encoding. For a list of code values, see `http\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters`_ .

  .. py:method:: confirm_subscription(**kwargs)

    

    Verifies an endpoint owner's intent to receive messages by validating the token sent to the endpoint by an earlier ``Subscribe`` action. If the token is valid, the action creates a new subscription and returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This call requires an AWS signature only when the ``AuthenticateOnUnsubscribe`` flag is set to "true".

    Sends a message to all of a topic's subscribed endpoints. When a ``messageId`` is returned, the message has been saved and Amazon SNS will attempt to deliver it to the topic's subscribers shortly. The format of the outgoing message to each subscribed endpoint depends on the notification protocol.

     

    To use the ``Publish`` action for sending a message to a mobile endpoint, such as an app on a Kindle device or mobile phone, you must specify the EndpointArn for the TargetArn parameter. The EndpointArn is returned when making a call with the ``CreatePlatformEndpoint`` action.

      Set ``MessageStructure`` to ``json`` if you want to send a different message for each protocol. For example, using one publish action, you can send a short message to your SMS subscribers and a longer message to your email subscribers. If you set ``MessageStructure`` to ``json`` , the value of the ``Message`` parameter must: 

       

       
      * be a syntactically valid JSON object; and 
       
      * contain at least a top-level JSON key of "default" with a value that is a string. 
       

       

      You can define other top-level keys that define the message you want to send to a specific transport protocol (e.g., "http").

       

      For information about sending different messages for each protocol using the AWS Management Console, go to `Create Different Messages for Each Protocol`_ in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Getting Started Guide* . 

       

      Valid value: ``json``  

      

    
    :type MessageAttributes: dict
    :param MessageAttributes: 

      Message attributes for Publish action.

      

    
      - *(string) --* 

      
        - *(dict) --* 

          The user-specified message attribute value. For string data types, the value attribute has the same restrictions on the content as the message body. For more information, see `Publish`_ .

           

          Name, type, and value must not be empty or null. In addition, the message body should not be empty or null. All parts of the message attribute, including name, type, and value, are included in the message size restriction, which is currently 256 KB (262,144 bytes). For more information, see `Using Amazon SNS Message Attributes`_ .

          

        
          - **DataType** *(string) --* **[REQUIRED]** 

            Amazon SNS supports the following logical data types: String, Number, and Binary. For more information, see `Message Attribute Data Types`_ .

            

          
          - **StringValue** *(string) --* 

            Strings are Unicode with UTF8 binary encoding. For a list of code values, see `http\://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters`_ .

            

          
          - **BinaryValue** *(bytes) --* 

            Binary type attributes can store any binary data, for example, compressed data, encrypted data, or images.
